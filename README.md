## Welcome to my_mastermind

Welcome to my_mastermind, a simple command-line implementation of the Mastermind game.

## Task

Your task is to guess the secret code generated by the program within a limited number of attempts. The secret code is a sequence of four digits, and each digit ranges from 0 to 8. You need to guess both the digits and their positions correctly.

## Description

The program generates a random secret code if none is provided through command-line arguments. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the code. After each guess, the program provides feedback on how well you've done:

- "Well place pieces" indicates how many digits you've guessed correctly and placed in the correct position.
- "Missed place pieces" indicates how many digits you've guessed correctly but placed in the wrong position.

Your goal is to guess the secret code within the given attempts.

## Installation

To install and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system.
2. Download the source code for my_mastermind.
3. Compile the source code using your C compiler. For example:
   
   gcc -o my_mastermind my_mastermind.c
   
4. Run the executable file generated by the compiler. For example:
   
   ./my_mastermind
   

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Upon running the program, you will be prompted to guess the secret code.
2. Enter your guess consisting of four digits between 0 and 8.
3. After each guess, the program will provide feedback on your guess.
4. Continue guessing until you either guess the correct code or exhaust your attempts.

### Command-line Options

- You can specify the number of attempts using the -t flag followed by the desired number of attempts. For example:
  
  ./my_mastermind -t 10
  
- You can provide a custom secret code using the -c flag followed by the code. For example:
  

  ./my_mastermind -c 1234
